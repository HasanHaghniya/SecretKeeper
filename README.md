## Primary Skills

**Fronend**

Javascript, +ES6

React (Redux n Redux Toolkit, Hooks, React Query or SWR )

Nextjs

Preactjs small n fast alternative for React 

despite have some experience in Vue and Nuxt for some years ago i dont wanna back to them

**Backend**

**Laravel**

I really like Laravel specially newer version(+5) and now we have 9 thats fit for most projects (dont tell me about performance, need performance with same laravel pattern? use Hyperf.io it also has some stunning extra features!) and it has some special features thats unique like IoC, EloquentORM(Active Record implementation), Eloquent Observers, Events , Queues and many , Also PHP is one most fast develpoing lang like JS

**Express, Fastify, Adonisjs, Uwebsockets.js**

Except Adonis other js frameworks are bare metal, you have implement yourself by your hand like authentication, validations , cache , DB queries, mailer , logger and others, for this kind to be honest you should have good experience to clean code , you should follow new best practices , because those framewroks haven't stracture and you have to build them yourself

here is some libs i love and use for Nodejs:

My favorite ORM for Node is Prisma! in my opinion thats best ORM ever i seen (Lucid Adonis also so cool), written in Rust, check it now if you didn't

I use JWT with any frameworks , does not matter the langs

Redis also my favorite cache system , i didnt test RabbitMQ or Memcached but i believe in Redis

JS Of course for years, the first script lang i learned , in 2011 Jquery 2 was the lib trend and now we have React

i also use [AJV.js](https://ajv.js.org) for data validation, its fastest and have good docs , also built by Mozilla team

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) my favorite server monitoring with support almost for most langs and platforms

Although Socket.io is most popular weboscket but for some projects i use (Uwebsockets.js)


### Favorite Programming Language

Rust, Kotlin (Android Developing using Jetpack Compose)

i am highly active on Rust and Android App Developing using Kotlin for about 2 years , i will share you some images that you see how much beautiful they are!

i just wanna tell you what i used in Rust and Kotlin and why they are so beatiful!

### Rust
[Actix and Actix Web Framework](https://actix.rs) most fastest web framework in the world with low memory footprint! its almost **13522%** faster than Laravel! [see your self](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r20&hw=ph&test=fortune) , its also support for WebSocket messaging which is so fast , i am using Actix in my two projects

[Diesel](https://diesel.rs) Crazy fast ORM for Rust , check the project test results on github as the website said its can load your data faster than **C**! thats huge

it has a good library for serialize & deserialize called **Serde** and **Chrono** for date and time , Rust also have good libraries for JWT

### Kotlin Jetpack Compose

[Google Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Good bye to XML and Java to develop android apps , if you check Jetpack Compose its like React , you define State , Components and you have ViewModel something like(just like but they are completely different) Redux , You have Service , BroadcastingReceving, WorkManager , i used all of them for 2 years and almost it is absolutely new experience compared Web Developing

[Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) I use Hilt for dependcy injection in Android , it is built on top of Dagger , i have no experience in Dagger before but i know in Hilt you write less some code , you dont have to create Dagger Component yourself

[ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io) i still did not use Room or Realm so i decided jump to ObjectBox , the good thing about ObjectBox is you can use it on other langs like Swift, C, C++, Go, Dart , and compared to Room and Realm its has more performance , also good coding style

For API calling my choice is Okhttp and Retrofit2 and Moshi for serialize and deserialize , for image loading and caching i suggest you [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) over Glide , Glide seems abandoned unlike Coil that have active community

### Favorite Games

Dota 2

World of Warcraft (started since 2005 lmao and left it for a year)

BattleField 1 and V ( i don’t like other versions)

### Favorite Editor

Jetbrains Stack for sure 

### International Activities
i worked about 3 4 years on Upwork(Odesk) i banned about 4 times because of sanctions lol! 

and 2 times my account suspended on Envato (Codecanyon and Themeforest) the last one was painfull because i almost lost 2100$ :( my rating was 5Stars and with +250 sales

to be honest i dont wanna work on those website again , i tried of banning i dont wanna start from 0 again, i just will start working with someone who living in countires that have good relation with West , you dont need to have experience in coding i will do it completly , just make an account and i will share 25% profit
